		<div class="answers-header">What food did Giovanna frequently choke on as a child?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Applesauce | Cheese | Hot dogs | Rice | <g style="color: #702626;">Salad</g> </div>
		<img src="images/salad.jpg" alt="Young Giovanna">
		<div class="body">When I was really little, I would frequently
		choke on salad at dinner time, to the point where my dad would have
		to pull it out of my throat. I would literally dread eating salad
		because I knew I would choke. The same also frequently happened
		with pasta!</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">What’s Giovanna’s favorite brand of shoe?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Birkenstocks | <g style="color: #702626;">Crocs</g> | Converse | Fake UGGs | Flip flops </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/crocsofficial.jpg" alt="Crocs"></div>
		<div class="body">I got crocs during middle school and never
		stopped wearing them. I despise flip flops and hate sandals so
		really crocs are the only logical choice for summer footwear for
		me. I also own a pair of dress shoe crocs because they were the
		only dress shoes I would let my mom buy for me (I also hate dress
		shoes)! Crocs are by far the superior shoe brand to all
		others.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">What article of clothing did Giovanna wear every day of the sixth grade?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">A hat | A headband | Leg warmers | <g style="color: #702626;">A scarf</g> | A sweatshirt </div>
		<div class="body">I wore a tacky multi-colored scarf every day and
		every season when I was in the sixth grade. I don’t have a good
		explanation for why I did this, because really it was a terrible
		decision and I got really hot when I wore it during the late summer
		and springtime at school. People would recognize me in later years
		because they knew me as that girl who wore a scarf every day of the
		sixth grade.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">Roughly how many photos of her dog does Giovanna have on her computer?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">15 | 30 | 100 | <g style="color: #702626;">180</g> | 260 </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/tobyofficial.jpg" alt="Toby"></div>
		<div class="body">I don’t live with my dog anymore so I take
		excessive amounts of pictures of him when I’m on break to
		hopelessly try to fill the void. It doesn’t really work.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">What was the first program Giovanna used to experiment with graphic design?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Google Slides | MS Paint | Photoshop | <g style="color: #702626;">PowerPoint</g> | Sketchbook Pro </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/ppofficial.jpg" alt="PowerPoint"></div>
		<div class="body">Way before I knew I wanted to be a graphic
		designer, I got really into PowerPoint because I learned how to use
		it from learning it in school. I made a lot of posters for fun and
		they were all pretty ugly because… I mean I was using PowerPoint.
		My senior year of high school, after actually becoming interested
		in graphic design, I realized that my making silly PowerPoints was
		just the very beginning of my path to being a graphic designer.
		Anyways, I’m very good at PowerPoint now.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">What’s Giovanna’s greatest fear?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Bats | Drowning | Heights | Kidnapping | <g style="color: #702626;">Spiders</g></div>
		<div class="body">One time I was at the supermarket and I saw a
		spider on my cart halfway through my shopping trip. I started
		panicking in the middle of the store and ended up picking up my
		abundance of groceries in my arms and then ran away in tears.
		Enough said.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">What was the first show Giovanna saw on Broadway?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Come From Away | Disaster! | <g style="color: #702626;">Kinky Boots</g> | The Prom | Waitress </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/kinkyboots.jpg" alt="Kinky Boots"></div>
		<div class="body">Kinky Boots is about a drag queen and a shoe
		maker who team up to start a business together. While I’ve seen
		every show listed, this was the first one that I saw on Broadway,
		and still one of the best musicals I’ve ever seen.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">Which character is the one Giovanna plays in Dungeons and Dragons?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Faen, half-elf sorcerer | Mara, half-genie paladin | <g style="color: #702626;">Natali, human ranger</g> | Thokk, half-orc druid | Vierna, dark elf cleric </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/natali.jpg" alt="Natali"></div>
		<div class="body">When making my DnD character, I purposely chose
		the what I thought to be the most basic race and class because
		everyone else was going all out with their stats and skills. I
		wanted to be really different from the rest of the characters by
		being the most normal one if that makes sense? It was kind of silly
		logic now that I look back on it.</div>

		<div class="answers-headerr">Who did Giovanna name her current car after?</div>
		<div class="answers-subheader">Lupita Nyong'o | <g style="color: #702626;">Percy Jackson</g> | Her grandmother, Rose | Suzanne Collins | Tony Stark </div>
		<div class= "images"><img src="images/percy.jpg" alt="Percy"></div>
		<div class="body2">Percy Jackson is one of my favorite literary
		characters of all time, so it makes complete sense that my car
		would be named after him.</div>
